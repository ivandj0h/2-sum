## Two Number Sum Problem

### About
Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers whose sum is equal to a given target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9.

The output should be [0, 1]. 
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9.
```
